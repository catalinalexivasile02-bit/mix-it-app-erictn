Modify the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` file to create the home feed with video content. This will involve creating a list of video items and displaying them in a visually appealing way.\n2.  Modify the `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` file to create the user profile screen. This will involve displaying user information and a grid of their uploaded videos.\n3.  Add a new screen for video creation/upload. This screen will include a button to record a video or upload one from the device's library.\n4.  Modify the `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` to ensure seamless navigation between the home feed, profile screen, and video creation/upload screen.\n\nAfter the coding agent implements the plan, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-04T18:00:17.442266"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a TikTok-Instagram hybrid app with a unique design!
